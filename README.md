Minesweeper, but with crabs!

Crabsweeper is my take on a reversed engineered Microsoft classic, Minesweeper.
It is full stack and was created using front-end frameworks AngularJS and Bootstrap with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL for the back-end.
Let me know if you have any comments, questions or found some bugs!
